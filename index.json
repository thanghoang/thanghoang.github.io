However, existing approaches predominantly rely on the similarity of instantaneous channel measurement samples between communicating devices. This narrow view of reciprocity is often impractical, as it is highly susceptible to noise, asynchronous sampling, channel fading, and other system-level imperfections---all of which significantly impair key generation performance. Furthermore, the quantization step common in traditional schemes introduces irreversible errors, further limiting efficiency. In this work, we propose a novel approach for secret-key generation by using wavelet scattering networks to extract robust and reciprocal CSI features. Dimensionality reduction is applied to uncover hidden cluster structures, which are then used to build hidden Markov models for efficient key agreement. Our approach eliminates the need for quantization and effectively captures channel randomness. It achieves a 5x improvement in key generation rate compared to traditional benchmarks, providing a secure and efficient solution for key generation in resource-constrained IoT environments.","tags":[],"title":"Secret-Key Agreement Through Hidden Markov Modeling of Wavelet Scattering Embeddings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hoang-Dung Nguyen*","Jorge Guajardo","Thang Hoang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1752476400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1752476400,"objectID":"a5c2b981ba03d336f2b90d3de7487e45","permalink":"https://thanghoang.github.io/publication/25_pets_pirex/","publishdate":"2025-02-24T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/25_pets_pirex/","section":"publication","summary":"Private Information Retrieval (PIR) permits clients to query data entries from a public database hosted on untrusted servers while preserving client privacy.

AccuRevoke enables clients to verify the revocation status of certificates efficiently without the need to contact Certificate Authorities (CAs) directly for each validation. By utilizing distributed accumulators and threshold cryptography, AccuRevoke ensures authenticity and integrity of revocation information, even when responses are generated by third-party Edge Compute Providers (ECPs).\\\nOur scheme significantly reduces bandwidth consumption by providing compact revocation proofs—approximately 21 bytes for membership proofs and 61 bytes for non-membership proofs—which are substantially smaller than traditional OCSP responses. To further optimize performance, especially in generating non-membership witnesses, we employ GPU acceleration, achieving considerable improvements in processing times.\\\nWe compare AccuRevoke with existing revocation mechanisms, demonstrating advantages in bandwidth efficiency, reliability, auditability, and potential enhancements in privacy.

Recently, hybrid SE (HSE) has combined SSE and PKSE to achieve the best of both worlds, including multi-writer encrypted search functionalities, forward privacy, and sublinear search with respect to database size.

In FL, data never leaves client devices; instead, clients only share locally computed gradients with a central server. As individual gradients may leak information about a given client’s dataset, secure aggregation was proposed. With secure aggregation, the server only receives the aggregate gradient update from the set of all sampled clients without being able to access any individual gradient. One challenge in FL is the systems-level heterogeneity that is quite often present among client devices. Specifically, clients in the FL protocol may have varying levels of compute power, on-device memory, and communication bandwidth. These limitations are addressed by model-heterogeneous FL schemes, where clients are able to train on subsets of the global model. Despite the benefits of model-heterogeneous schemes in addressing systems-level challenges, the implications of these schemes on client privacy have not been thoroughly investigated.\\\nIn this paper, we investigate whether the nature of model distribution and the computational heterogeneity among client devices in model-heterogeneous FL schemes may result in the server being able to recover sensitive data from target clients. To this end, we propose two attacks in the model-heterogeneous FL setting, even with secure aggregation in place. We call these attacks the Convergence Rate Attack and the Rolling Model Attack. The Convergence Rate Attack targets schemes where clients train on the same subset of the global model, while the Rolling Model Attack targets schemes where model parameters are dynamically updated each round. We show that a malicious adversary can compromise the model and data confidentiality of a target group of clients. We evaluate our attacks on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets and show that using our techniques, an adversary can reconstruct data samples with near perfect accuracy for batch sizes of up to 20 samples.","tags":[],"title":"Breaking Privacy in Model-Heterogeneous Federated Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Haodi Wang*","Rongfang Bie","Thang Hoang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1723964400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1723964400,"objectID":"31e34c19f65f18be20bfe5b5edf9ae82","permalink":"https://thanghoang.github.io/publication/24_tdsc_ezdps/","publishdate":"2024-06-18T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/24_tdsc_ezdps/","section":"publication","summary":"Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) offers powerful data analytics services to clients with limited resources.

In particular, cold storage applications (e.g., MS Azure, Amazon Glacier) require regular and frequent audits but with less frequent data modification. Yet, despite their merits, existing PoR techniques generally focus on other metrics (e.g., low storage, fast update, metadata privacy) but not audit efficiency (e.g., low audit time, small proof size). Hence, there is a need to develop new PoR techniques that achieve efficient data audit while preserving update and retrieval performance.\\\nIn this paper, we propose Porla, a new PoR framework that permits efficient data audit, update, and retrieval functionalities simultaneously. Porla permits data audit in both private and public settings, each of which features asymptotically (and concretely) smaller audit-proof size and lower audit time than all the prior works while retaining the same asymptotic data update overhead. Porla achieves all these properties by composing erasure codes with verifiable computation techniques which, to our knowledge, is a new approach to PoR design. We address several challenges that arise in such a composition by creating a new homomorphic authenticated commitment scheme, which can be of independent interest. We fully implemented Porla and evaluated its performance on commodity cloud (i.e., Amazon EC2) under various settings. Experimental results demonstrated that Porla achieves two to four orders of magnitude smaller audit proof size with 4× – 2,000× lower audit time than all prior schemes in both private and public audit settings at the cost of only 2× – 3× slower update.","tags":[],"title":"Efficient Dynamic Proof of Retrievability for Cold Storage","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thao M.

The notion ensures the accuracy performance of the biometric systems can be preserved after the cancellable biometric technique is applied. Random Projection is among the most commonly adopted method in cancellable biometric schemes. However, it is reversible subject to certain conditions, which disrupts the template irreversibility criterion. This invites vulnerabilities for random projection-based schemes. In this paper, we propose a novel transform function, namely Absolute Value Equations Transform (AVET), which non-linearly projects feature vectors to another domain. The transformed templates hold two main merits ensuring the user’s privacy, and maintaining the system’s performance simultaneously. First, by relying on the hardness of the Absolute Value Equations problem, we guarantee that AVET satisfies irreversibility. Second, by using Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma and the inverse triangle inequality, we prove that the proposed approach has the similarity preserving property. Notably, rigorous theoretical proofs and empirical experiments are provided. The efficacy of AVET is comprehensively evaluated on both physiological and behavioral biometrics including face, ear, fingerprint, and gait. With unimodal approach, we achieve competitive performances compared to related algorithms on eight public datasets. Regarding bimodal mode, the AVET surpasses the state-of-the-art technique on all three observed datasets.

Internet of Things (IoT) applications harbor vast quantities of connected devices that collect a massive amount of sensitive information (e.g., medical, financial), which is usually analyzed either at the edge or federated cloud systems via AI/Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to make critical decisions (e.g., diagnosis). It is of paramount importance to ensure the security, privacy, and trustworthiness of data collection, analysis, and decision-making processes. However, system complexity and increased attack surfaces make these applications vulnerable to system breaches, single-point of failures, and various cyber-attacks. Moreover, the advances in quantum computing exacerbate the security and privacy challenges. That is, emerging quantum computers can break conventional cryptographic systems that offer cyber-security services, public key infrastructures, and privacy-enhancing technologies. Therefore, there is a vital need for new cyber-security paradigms that can address the resiliency, long-term security, and efficiency requirements of distributed cyber infrastructures.\\\nIn this work, we propose a vision of distributed architecture and cybersecurity framework that uniquely synergizes secure compu- tation, Physical Quantum Key Distribution (PQKD), NIST Post- Quantum Cryptography (PQC) efforts, and AI/ML algorithms to achieve breach-resilient, functional and efficient cybersecurity services. At the heart of our proposal lies a new Multi-Party Computation Quantum Network Core (MPC-QNC) that enables fast and yet quantum-safe execution of distributed computation protocols via integration of PQKD infrastructure and hardware- acceleration elements. We showcase the capabilities of MPC-QNC by instantiating it for Public Key Infrastructures (PKI) and federated ML in our HDQPKI and TPQ-ML, frameworks, respectively. HDQPKI (to the best of our knowledge) is the first hybrid and distributed post-quantum PKI that harnesses PQKD and NIST PQC standards to offer the highest level of quantum safety with a breach-resiliency against active adversaries.

Recently, the adoption of deep learning techniques has gained significant performance improvement. However, most existing studies focused on exploiting the spatial information of gait data (using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)) while the temporal part received little attention. In this study, we propose a new multi-model Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) network for learning the gait temporal features. First, we observe that LSTM is able to capture the pattern hidden inside the gait data sequences that are out-of-synchronization. Thus, instead of using the gait cycle-based segment, our model accepts the gait cycle-free segment (i.e., fixed-length window) as the input. By this, the classification task does not depend on the gait cycle detection task, which usually suffers from noise and bias. Second, we propose a new LSTM network architecture, in which, one LSTM is used for each gait data channel and a group of consecutive signals is processed in each step. This strategy allows the network to effectively handle the long input data sequence and achieve improved performance compared to existing LSTM-based gait models. In addition, besides using the LSTM alone, we extend it by combining with a CNN model to construct a hybrid network, which further improves the recognition performance. We evaluated our LSTM and hybrid networks under different settings using the whuGAIT and OU-ISIR datasets. The experiments showed that our LSTM network outperformed the existing LSTM networks, and its combination with CNN established new state-of-the-art performance on both the verification and identification tasks.","tags":[],"title":"Multi-Model Long Short-Term Memory Network for Gait Recognition Using Window-Based Data Segment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thang Hoang","Rouzbeh Behnia","Yeongjin Jang","Attila A.

Oblivious Random Access Machine (ORAM) can seal such leakages, but the recent studies showed significant challenges on the integration of ORAM into databases. Specifically, the direct usage of ORAM on databases is not only costly but also permits very limited query functionalities. We propose new oblivious data structures called Oblivious Matrix Structure (OMAT) and Oblivious Tree Structure (OTREE), which allow tree-based ORAM to be integrated into database systems in a more efficient manner with diverse query functionalities supported. OMAT provides special ORAM packaging strategies for table structures, which not only offers a significantly better performance but also enables a broad range of query types that may not be practical in existing frameworks. OTREE allows oblivious conditional queries to be deployed on tree-indexed databases more efficient than existing techniques.

The main idea is to create a distributed encrypted incidence matrix on two non-colluding servers such that no arbitrary queries on these servers can be linked to each other. This strategy prevents not only recent statistical attacks on the encrypted data structure but also other potential threats exploiting query linkability. Our security analysis proves that DOD-DSSE ensures the unlinkability of queries and, therefore, offers much higher security than traditional DSSE. At the same time, our performance evaluation demonstrates that DOD-DSSE is two orders of magnitude faster than ORAM-based techniques (e.g., Path ORAM), since it only incurs a small-constant number of communication overhead. That is, we deployed DOD-DSSE on geographically distributed Amazon EC2 servers, and showed that, a search/update operation on a very large dataset only takes around one second with DOD-DSSE, while it takes 3 to 13 minutes with Path ORAM-based methods.","tags":[],"title":"Practical and Secure Dynamic Searchable Encryption via Oblivious Access on Distributed Data Structure","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thang Hoang","Thuc Nguyen","Deokjai Choi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1446871348,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1446871348,"objectID":"c86f3e0bf1b76128cd3bcf55c6df08d0","permalink":"https://thanghoang.github.io/publication/15_ijis/","publishdate":"2015-11-06T21:42:28-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/15_ijis/","section":"publication","summary":"Authentication systems using gait captured from inertial sensors have been recently developed to enhance the limitation of existing mechanisms on mobile devices and achieved promising results.
